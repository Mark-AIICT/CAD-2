I've thrown this example to show that the course notes are incorrect in the section where serialization choices are discussed. If you followed the notes you would be led to believe that XML serialization is inferior to binary serialization because private data are not serialized. In this example I'm using a class called the NetContractSerializer which clearly serializes private data.

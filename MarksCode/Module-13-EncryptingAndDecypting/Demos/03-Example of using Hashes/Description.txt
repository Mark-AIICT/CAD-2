In this example I've created a Web Service that supports uploading and downloading files. When a file is transferred it's done so in chunks to minimise the memory used on the web server. A has is calculated against the file at the 'sender' end and then, after the file has been reassembled at the 'receiver' end, calculated again. The two hashes are compared to ensure the file is OK. BEFORE RUNNING THIS EXAMPLE YOU NEED TO INSTALL MICROSOFT WSE (Web Server Extensions) first.

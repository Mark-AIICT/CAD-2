EF Code first was introduced in EF 4.1. To build an EF Code first application use the NuGet Package manager to add the latest Entity Framework. The example I've written includes the use of Database.SetInitializer which was the way to update a database schema when the model changes in EF 4.1, basically it drops and re-creates the database. Since the release of EF 4.3 it's possible to perform 'database migrations'. To do this run 'Enable-Migrations' from the package manager console, change your classes (model), then run 'Add-Migration'. Lastly run 'Update-Database'.

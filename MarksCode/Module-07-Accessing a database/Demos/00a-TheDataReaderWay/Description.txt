Before we had the entity framework writing a C# application that performed CRUD operations on a database was cumbersome. Why? because we would need to write extensive amounts of code to move the data coming from a database into our C# conceptual schema (i.e. our C# classes). Relational database schema usually do not match the OO class structure we write in our code, so we'd have to write a whole heap of mapping code.

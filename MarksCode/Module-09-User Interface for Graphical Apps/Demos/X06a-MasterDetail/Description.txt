In this example I've created an application that exhibits
Master/detail functionality. To understand how it works look at the 
town.cs file and then the ObservableTownsCollection.cs file, notice
how a customersCollection is a property of a town. Then look at the
Window1.Xaml file and notice the DataContext property on the grid as well 
as the ItemsSource and IsSynchronizedWithCurrentItem properties of the 
listboxes within the grid.

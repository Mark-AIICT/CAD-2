# Using GitHub To Save Your Work.

It's my recommendation that you create a GitHub account to save any ad-hoc work you do in the lab environment or on your own computer.

## How?

1. Go to https://www.github.com and sign up for a new account. You only need to do this once.
2. While in GitHub create a new public repository. You only need to do this once for this course.
3. Get the URL to the Git Repo you've created and copy it to your clipboard.
4. From inside a lab environment execute the command **"git clone "** followed by your **repo url**. 
5. Add files to the repo on the lab machine as you go along and then when you're ready, execute **"git add ."** and **"git commit -m 'some message' "** and **"git push"**. Do it often so as not to lose any of your work.

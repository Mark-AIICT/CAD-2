# Information regarding the labs for 20483 (C#)

I've written a few notes here for you to help  when it comes to doing the labs. There are a few key things to keep in mind:

1. The lab environment runs on a Virtual Machine in the cloud. All of the labs have a timeout and when that  timeout expires everything on the Virtual Machine is destroyed. Consequently, if you want to keep any work you've done you need to store it elsewhere. I'll show you how to do that using github.
2. The labs are located here: https://ddls.learnondemand.net.
3. Whenever you launch a new lab environment I'd like you to run a script I've written to install additional software. The lab environments were created several years ago and it would be good to bring a few things up-to-date. The instructions for running the script are below:
 
## Do this every time you start a new lab environment
1. run **cmd.exe** from the Windows  Start button.
2. Run the command **git clone https://github.com/Mark-AIICT/CAD-2.git C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\MarksFiles**
3. Navigate to **C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\MarksFiles\setups**, then right-mouse click **bootstrap.cmd** and **run as administrator**
4. Change your display settings in your lab to a better resolution if necesary.
5. Change your default browser to google chrome. (I would have liked to install the latest version of the Microsoft Edge browser but it isn't compatible the the version of Windows in the lab).

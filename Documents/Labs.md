# Information regarding the labs for 20483 (C#)

I've written a few notes here for you to help  when it comes to doing the labs. There are a few key things to keep in mind:

1. The lab environment runs on a Virtual Machine in the cloud. All of the labs have a timeout and when that  timeout expires everything on the Virtual Machine is destroyed. Consequently, if you want to keep any work you've done you need to store it elsewhere. I'll show you how to do that using github. You'll find that if you're using the lab and it's about to timeout you'll be asked if you'd like to extend it for an hour.
2. You can access the labs from Study Spot.
3. On the **desktop** of the Virtual Machine you'll find a folder called **LabFiles\AllFiles**. This folder has the starter and solution for every lab in the course.
4. To run Visual Studio on the lab virtual machines you will need to sign in to Visual Studio. You can either sign-in with an existing Microsoft account or create a new one for the course by visiting https://www.outlook.com.
5. If you're not doing anything in the lab for a while, for example you've gone outside to catch a spider, press the **save** button to snap-freeze the lab so you can pick up where you left off later.

### Do this every time you start a new lab environment
1. run **cmd.exe**
2. Type **cd desktop** while in the command prompt
3. run the command **git clone https://github.com/Mark-AIICT/CAD-2.git**
4. Navigate to your desktop, find the folder called **CAD-2**, navigate to the sub-folder **setups**, right-mouse click **bootstrap.cmd** and **run as administrator**
5. Change your display settings to a better resolution
6. It's a good idea to then reboot the lab machine
